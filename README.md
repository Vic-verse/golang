- RaceCondition-Go

+ Race Condition:      
		A data race happens when two goroutines access the same variable concurrently, and at least one of the access is a write instruction.
		Detecting a race..

+ Use the command:

			go run -race routineOne.go to generate the race report
			uncomment line 28
			go run -race routineOne.go to generate the race report

+ Conclusion:

		•	Result one and two generates 2 different Final Counter after adding wait period
		•	Adding the pause caused the result to fail (should be 4)
		•	-race parameter generates a report to find data races.
		•	The report describes when the write value happened
		The example provided commenting/uncommenting line 28 shows the difference of context switching
		Without pause
---------------------------------------
		Without the pause, the final Counter value = 4
		This is because, before the second routine is executed (Line 13), routine 1 loop has already completed
		writing the value to Counter.
		Hence;
		Loop 1 -> Increment -> Context Switch -> Loop 2
		With pause
---------------------------------------
		With the pause, the context switch happens before routine 1 loop is finished.
		Therefore resulting to final counter value = 2
		Hence
		Loop 1 -> Context Switch -> Loop 2
		Resulting the second loop to start count from 0, instead of 2
